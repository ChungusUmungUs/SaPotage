# SaPotage

This repository contains an unfinished Unity 2D build of an early digital prototype of my card game "SaPotage." As this is one of my earliest Unity projects, the functionality is fairly low, but it contains some of the first lessons I learned in my digital development journey. The project has since been abandoned due to a major design shift in the physical card game and will likely not see an update.
